   <p class="heading">Use Case Context</p>

    <p>
        This use case supports integration between the EMR and lab systems in order to effectively process lab requests and have the results returned to the EMR for diagnosis.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, this use case illustrates the need for a Centralised Data Repository (DR) and a Client Registry (CR) to enable regional and/or national HIV case reporting. 
        <br />
        <br />
        The <a href="index.html#technicalBackground">technical specificaton documentation</a> for the Data Integration Strategies &amp; Implementation reference platform identifies the following technologies for the two aforementioned centralised repositories.

    <h3 id="use-case-summary">Use Case Summary</h3> <a name="usecase-summary"> </a>
    <p class="heading">Register Client</p>

    <p>
        Before an individual can be screened and assessed (diagnosis) for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the individual must be registered into the EMR at the assessing facility/organisation.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, this use case documents the HIV Key Population associated with this sentinel event.
    </p>

     <ul>
        <li><strong>General Population</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Men who have sex with men (MSM):</strong> <a href="https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full%26conceptId1=472986005%26edition=MAIN/2023-01-31%26release=%26languages=en%26latestRedirect=false" target="_blank">472986005</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p class="heading">HIV Diagnosis</p>

    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to document the HIV infection status (HIV positive or negative) for an individual.
        Typically, this will only happen upon confirmation of blood sample examination.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, this use case documents the <u>key</u> metadata associated with this sentinel event.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Enrolled Into Care</p>

    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to enrol a HIV positive individual into an Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) program as fast as possible so that Antiretroviral (ARV) treatment can commence.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, this use case includes the following <u>key</u> data.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Metadata</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="heading">ART Initiation</p>

    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to initiate an HIV positive patient onto a given ARV regimen and associate it with a specific therapeutic line.
        Therapeutic line is the term used to describe the order in which different therapies (ARV regimen) are given to patients as their disease progresses.
        An ARV regimen is a substance that kills or suppresses a retrovirus, such as HIV <a href="#ref1" id="citation1">(VA.gov | Veterans Affairs, 2019)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">ART Regimen Switching</p>
        
    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to change the current ARV regimen to a new ARV regimen from any therapeutic line.
        A change in the ARV regimen is often necessary because of both acute and chronic toxicities, concomitant clinical conditions, and development of virologic failure <a href="#ref2" id="citation2">(Wilkin et al., 2006)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Viral Load Results - (First &amp; Subsequent)</p>
        
    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to retrospectively capture the viral load (VL) results for first and follow-up examinations.
        In addition, should there be laboratory integration with the EMR, the laboratory system must be able to automatically document the VL count to the patient record in the EMR.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to <a href="#ref3" id="citation3">Moncivaiz (2021)</a>, VL examinations typically take place at the following frequencies.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>When first diagnosed with HIV.</li>
        <li>Within 2 months if there is a change in ARV regimen.</li>
        <li>Every 1 to 2 months until the VL is no longer detectable (virally suppressed).</li>
        <li>Every 3 to 4 months while ART remains stable and the viral load remains suppressed.</li>
        <li>Every 6 months after 2 years while VL remains undetectable, and CD4 counts are over 500 cells/mm3.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="heading">CD4 Results - (First &amp; Subsequent)</p>
        
    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to retrospectively capture the CD4 results for first and follow-up examinations.
        In addition, should there be laboratory integration with the EMR, the laboratory system must be able to automatically document the CD4 count to the patient record in the EMR.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to <a href="#ref4" id="citation4">Medlineplus (2022)</a>, a CD4 count is conducted with every VL examination. It is used to determine if the patient's current ARV regimen is stable or requires a regimen switch.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Patient Outcome</p>
        
    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to document the event associated with the death of a patient.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">HIV Recency Testing</p>
        
    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to retrospectively capture the VL result for a HIV recency examination.
        In addition, should there be laboratory integration with the EMR, the laboratory system must be able to automatically document the VL count to the patient record in the EMR.
        <br />
        <br />
        According to <a href="#ref5" id="citation5">Recency Learning Hub (n.d.)</a>, VL testing is highly recommended to be included when testing for recent infections as part of recent infection testing algorithm (RITA). 
        HIV recency testing should be offered as an additional test to clients who are confirmed as newly diagnosed with HIV-1 based on the national HIV testing algorithm <a href="#ref5">(Recency Learning Hub, n.d.)</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Submit lab order</p>

    <p>
        The healthcare professional must be able to submit a request from the EMR for a sample to be collected and examined at the laboratory. 
        <br />
        <br />

        A lab request, in the context of this implementation guide, will typically contain the following <u>key</u> data. 
    </p>

     <ul>
        <li>Metadata</li>
        <li>Order number</li>
        <li>Test requested code</li>

            </ul>
        <li>Specimen ID</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="heading">Sample Collection</p>

    <p>
        A lab assistant must be able to collect samples that have been submitted for testing from the EMR.
        <br />
        <br />

        Sample collection in the context of this implementation guide, will typically contain the following <u>key</u> data. 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Metadata</li>
        <li>Sample collection date &amp; time</li>
        <li>Specimen type</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Same as the <u>submit lab order</u> use case</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Specimen ID</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="heading">Process Lab Request</p>

    <p>
        A lab assistant must be able to close the request for sample examination using one of the following three statuses.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The specimen was successfully examined and the result issued (<a href="lab-result-bundle.html">lab result</a>)</li>
        <li>The request for sample examination was cancelled by the lab order requester (<a href="lab-cancellation-bundle.html">lab cancellation</a>)</li>
        <li>The specimen examination was rejected by the lab performer without carrying out any part of the test (<a href="lab-rejection-bundle.html">lab rejection</a>)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
