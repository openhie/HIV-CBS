  <h3>Introduction</h3> <a name="intro"> </a>

  <p>
    This implementation guide supports the needs for the following two key reporting areas. 
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Monitoring &amp; measuring the progress towards being <a href="vaccination_status.html#up-to-date-vaccinated">up-to-date vaccinated</a> for COVID19.</li>
    <li>Assists with the monitoring &amp; measuring of COVID19 cases among the HIV population.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <br />
    This implementation guide was derived using a <a href="requirements.html">functional requirement specification</a> which was developed to support the following key use cases.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Client Registration</li>
    <li>COVID19 Screening &amp; Assessments</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes restrospective capturing of COVID19 events that took place at other health facilities/organisations.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>COVID19 Client Outcome</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Died</li>
            <li>Recovered</li>
            <li>Long COVID / Post-COVID</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Lab Integration</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Orders</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Support rejection of orders.</li>
                    <li>Support cancellation of orders.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Results</li>
        </ul>
    <li>COVID19 Immunisation Tracking</li>
         <ul>
            <li><a href="vaccination_status.html">Vaccination Status</a></li>
            <li>Vaccine Scheduling</li>
        </ul>
     <li>Case Reporting</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Reporting Objectives</h3> <a name="objectives"> </a>

  <p>
    This following key case reporting objectives have been identified for this implementation guide.
  </p>

  <p class="heading">Direct Support</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Direct support</strong> means that this implementation guide has been tailored to specifically support the following reporting needs.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>To calculate the number of individuals who have been tested for COVID19 within the reporting period.</li>
    <li>To calculate the number of individuals who have been diagnosed COVID19 positive within the reporting period.</li>
    <li>To calculate the number of vaccinated individuals per <a href="vaccination_status.html">vacination status</a> within the reporting period.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="heading">Integrated Support</p>

  <p>
    <strong>Integrated support</strong> means that this implementation guide gets referenced together with other implementation guides based on the level of functionality and reporting needs offered by the system.
    <br />
    <br />
    The following reporting objectives are achievable when this implementation guide is referenced by the same system concerned with <a href="https://github.com/openhie/HIV-CBS" target="_blank">HIV case reporting</a>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>To assist with the calculation in regards to the number of HIV+ individuals who have been tested for COVID19 within the reporting period.</li>
    <li>To assist with the calculation in regards to the number of HIV+ individuals who are tested COVID19 positive within the reporting period.</li>
    <li>
        To assist with the calculation in regards to the number of vaccinated HIV+ individuals per <a href="vaccination_status.html">vacination status</a> within the reporting period.
        <ul>
            <li>Additionally, assist with the count of those individuals who have been confirmed to be COVID19 positive.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
